# RedditRobin-ChatBot  
## A bot made in javascript.  
To run:  
1. Find a tutorial on how to open that javascript console for your browser.  
2. Paste the code from index.js file into the console.  
3. Hit enter  

The bot is now running in your current room.  
Whenever it switches (Ex: it goes to next room when majority grows) you will have to do it again.  

The commands are:  
* #help  
* #hello  
* #highfive <name>
